      <h2>Student Robotics</h2>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Completed - 9th Place </p>
      <p><strong>About:</strong> This was a student competition for 6th form and college students. 
                                 The competition involved building a robot to compete against others 
                                 in an arena. Me and my team were able to build a virtual robot that
                                 was able to reach 9th place in the virtual competition: our 6th form's 
                                 first ever competition! The hosts considered us as one of the few 
                                 teams to reach such a high ranking with no prior experience. </p>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python | Arduino </p>
