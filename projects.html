                                     This website allows users to make accounts and test their knowledge 
                                     on certain subjects via pre-generated quizzes. Users are also able 
                                     to monitor their progress by viewing their most recent quizzes. </p>

          <p><strong>Date: </strong>October 2023 → March 2024</p>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Completed - 9th Place </p>
          <p><strong>About:</strong> This was a student competition for 6th form and college students. 
                                     The competition involved building a robot to compete against others 
                                     in an arena. Me and my team were able to build a virtual robot that
                                     was able to reach 9th place in the virtual competition: our 6th form's 
                                     first ever competition! The hosts considered us as one of the few 
                                     teams to reach such a high ranking with no prior experience. </p>

        <button class="projectTitle button"><h2>Portal-Themed Bluetooth Speaker</h2></button>
        <div class="projectDetails">
          <p><strong>Date: </strong>TBD</p>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Work In Progress </p>
          <p><strong>About:</strong> This small project of mine is to be a custom-built speaker, inspired by the 
                                     iconic design of the radio from Valve's <i>Portal</i>. This will feature a 3D
                                     printed case and Bluetooth connectivity, where I am able to play any music from 
                                     my phone directly to the speaker. A small LED screen will be used to display the 
                                     design's "radio frequency", or alternatively display the song currently being
                                     played - all controlled by an Arduino. This will be powered via Li-ion 
                                     batteries - though I may replace this with a rechargable battery pack instead. 
                                     When turned on, the speaker will glow in blue from LED lights concealed behind 
                                     translucent materials.  </p>
